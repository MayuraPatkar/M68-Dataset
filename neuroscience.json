      "input": "What are some potential mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity?",
      "output": "Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time in response to activity, involves various mechanisms, including changes in neurotransmitter release, postsynaptic receptor density, and synaptic structure. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are classic forms of synaptic plasticity that underlie learning and memory processes in the brain."

      "input": "What are some potential mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation?",
      "output": "Neuroinflammation involves activation of the brain's immune response in response to injury, infection, or neurodegeneration. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, release inflammatory mediators and phagocytose debris to remove pathogens and damaged cells. However, dysregulated neuroinflammatory responses can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment."

      "output": "Olfactory information processing involves specialized brain regions such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. These regions analyze odor molecules detected by olfactory receptors in the nasal epithelium to create perceptual representations of smells. Olfactory perception is closely linked to memory, emotion, and behavior, influencing food preferences, mate choice, and social interactions."

      "input": "What are some potential applications of neurofeedback?",
      "output": "Neurofeedback, a form of biofeedback that uses real-time brain activity measurements to train self-regulation of neural patterns, has applications in treating various neurological and psychiatric disorders. These include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, depression, epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and insomnia. Neurofeedback aims to modulate brain activity patterns associated with symptoms and promote adaptive neural functioning."
