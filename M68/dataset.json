In prometaphase, the spindle apparatus forms and attaches to the centromeres of the chromosomes. During metaphase, the chromosomes align at the cell's equator. In anaphase, the sister chromatids separate and move towards opposite poles. Finally, in telophase, the chromosomes decondense, and two new nuclei form."

        "input": "What is the process of mitosis?",
        "output": "Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells with the same number and type of chromosomes as the parent cell. It consists of several stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. During prophase, the chromatin condenses into visible chromosomes, and the nuclear envelope breaks down. In metaphase, the chromosomes align at the metaphase plate. In anaphase, sister chromatids separate and move to opposite poles. Finally, in telophase, two new nuclei form around the separated chromosomes."
